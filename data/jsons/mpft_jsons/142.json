The old pattern used `start_time=16000`\r\nwhich could result in negative durations when we calculate durations time.monotonic() < 16000,\r\ncausing the timeout logic to fail.\r\n\r\nI repkace that with populating start_time relative to current monotonic time,\r\nto guarantee the processor always runs for exactly\r\n(timeout + 1) seconds, to ensure consistent timeout behaviour across\r\nall environments.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/contributing-docs/05_pull_requests.rst#pull-request-guidelines)** for more information.\r\nIn case of fundamental code changes, an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvement+Proposals)) is needed.\r\nIn case of a new dependency, check compliance with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\nIn case of backwards incompatible changes please leave a note in a newsfragment file, named `{pr_number}.significant.rst` or `{issue_number}.significant.rst`, in [airflow-core/newsfragments](https://github.com/apache/airflow/tree/main/airflow-core/newsfragments).\r\n",
