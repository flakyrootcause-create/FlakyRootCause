We\u2019re going live with 3.31.\n+\n+Discussion with the V8 team suggests that 3.31 is probably not appropriate because of stability concerns. We have already had to disable class support because the V8 team announced their intention to disable it in the next release anyway.\n+\n+Group agreed to stick with 3.31, too late to do otherwise. Come up with a more solid stability policy later.\n+\n+### v1.0.0 release checklist\n+\n+https://github.com/iojs/io.js/issues/302\n+\n+* Rod will land LICENSE change after meeting\n+* Bert spoke about the v0.10 and the things that remain unmerged\n+  - abort on uncaughtException for domains not landed, so may be missed; feature used by Hapi / Walmart Labs for postmoretem debugging\n+  - private buffer object patch not landed, repl will crash if you do this currently\n+  - sslv2 & sslv3 fixes -- we have agreed to disable these completely\n+  - re timers slowness - Bert and Ben don\u2019t like the 0.10 fix, need to find our own - not landing in 1.0.0, probably our own fix in 1.0.1\n+* Bert spoke about node.exe, has code for it but it\u2019s crashy, could release with a symlink for 1.0.0. Asked for input on the approach.\n+* Discussed node-gyp - Ben to PR node-gyp (and maybe land a modified version in io.js codebase) for iojs.org/dist/vx.y.z/... for source tarball.\n+  - discussed process.versions.iojs property, https://github.com/iojs/io.js/issues/269 - group agreed to do nothing on this. Rod to find discussion or create issue to have discussion on this.\n+  - discussed visual assets not being in the repo, currently copied by CI manually into src, Rod to land a PR with them\n+* Rod: Changelog, we don\u2019t have one.\n+  - https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/API-changes-between-v0.10-and-v0.12\n+  - Rod: is it a blocker? Ben: not per-se but very good to have.\n+  - Rod: proposed to come up with something on GitHub and ask for people to take work. Trevor will do Buffer, Chris streams, Bert child processes.\n+\n+\n+### Next meeting\n+\n+* Back to normal schedule next week"
