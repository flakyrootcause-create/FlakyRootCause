  "issue_description": "Further lower threshold for F64 in //xla/service/gpu/model:hlo_op_profiler_test\n\nThis was originally proposed in https://github.com/openxla/xla/pull/16102, but I still ran into issue where it failed by slight margin:\n\n```\nExpected: (profiler.MeasureClockCyclesPerOp(HloOpcode::kDivide, F64) .value() .clock_cycles()) > (300), actual: 296 vs 300\n```\n\nThat said, I ran 1000 tests and did not encounter this issue. Reducing the threshold to 280 since the bound seems very close and flaky test is no good either way.\n",
