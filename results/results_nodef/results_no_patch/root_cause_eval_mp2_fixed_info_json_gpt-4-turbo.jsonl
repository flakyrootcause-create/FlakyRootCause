This change fixes the issue by increasing the poll interval to 2 seconds and the sleep duration to 3 seconds, such that on a reasonably responsive system we will poll twice per task, with the sleep ending in the middle of the two polls.\r\n    \r\nThe include_me.yml file does not exist in this integration test. It has been added.\r\n    \r\nThe remote_tmp_dir.path expression is invalid - the setup_remote_tmp_dir role uses set_fact to set remote_tmp_dir to remote_tmp_dir.path.\r\n    \r\nThe integration tests run with ANSIBLE_HOST_PATTERN_MISMATCH=error, meaning that the final play was never reached. Set ANSIBLE_HOST_PATTERN_MISMATCH=warning to continue past the play and trigger the v2_playbook_on_no_hosts_matched callback.\n"}

So this points to some\nstate that is not cleared between the tests  - and indeed, the test\ncreates a topic “inputTopic”, produces to it, but doesn’t delete it, so\nthe second variation will run with produce to it again and then run with\ntwice the data.\n\nI also reduced heartbeat interval and session timeout since some of the\ntests need to wait for the old consumer to leave which (sigh) Kafka\nStreams doesn't do, so we have to wait that it gets kicked out by\nsession timeout. So previously we waited for 45 seconds, now, we at\nleast wait only 1 second.\n\nReviewers: Bill Bejeck <bbejeck@apache.org>, Chia-Ping Tsai\n <chia7712@gmail.com>\n\n"}

This change fixes the issue by increasing the poll interval to 2 seconds and the sleep duration to 3 seconds, such that on a reasonably responsive system we will poll twice per task, with the sleep ending in the middle of the two polls.\r\n    \r\nThe include_me.yml file does not exist in this integration test. It has been added.\r\n    \r\nThe remote_tmp_dir.path expression is invalid - the setup_remote_tmp_dir role uses set_fact to set remote_tmp_dir to remote_tmp_dir.path.\r\n    \r\nThe integration tests run with ANSIBLE_HOST_PATTERN_MISMATCH=error, meaning that the final play was never reached. Set ANSIBLE_HOST_PATTERN_MISMATCH=warning to continue past the play and trigger the v2_playbook_on_no_hosts_matched callback.\n"}

The script declared in PreStop is as follows:\r\n```\r\nsh -c '\r\ntouch /persistent/my-container.log;\r\necho $(date -u +%FT$(nmeter -d0 '%3t' | head -n1)Z) '\\''prestop-my-container Starting 0'\\'' | tee -a /persistent/my-container.log >> /proc/1/fd/1;\r\n_term() { sleep 0; echo $(date -u +%FT$(nmeter -d0 '%3t' | head -n1)Z) '\\''prestop-my-container Exiting'\\'' | tee -a /persistent/my-container.log >> /proc/1/fd/1; exit 0; };\r\ntrap _term TERM;\r\ntouch started;\r\necho $(date -u +%FT$(nmeter -d0 '%3t' | head -n1)Z) '\\''prestop-my-container Started'\\'' | tee -a /persistent/my-container.log >> /proc/1/fd/1;\r\necho $(date -u +%FT$(nmeter -d0 '%3t' | head -n1)Z) '\\''prestop-my-container Delaying 0'\\'' | tee -a /persistent/my-container.log >> /proc/1/fd/1;\r\nwhile true; do\r\n  echo $(date -u +%FT$(nmeter -d0 '%3t' | head -n1)Z) '\\''prestop-my-container Looping'\\'' | tee -a /persistent/my-container.log >> /proc/1/fd/1;\r\n  sleep 1;\r\ndone;\r\necho $(date -u +%FT$(nmeter -d0 '%3t' | head -n1)Z) '\\''prestop-my-container Exiting'\\'' | tee -a /persistent/my-container.log >> /proc/1/fd/1;\r\nexit 0'\r\n```\r\nIt exhibits the following issues:\r\n\r\n1. The while loop execution time isn't consistently 1 second - it often takes slightly longer by tens of milliseconds\r\n\r\n2. The start/end times of the while loop vary across containers (not just loop execution variance, but also hundreds of milliseconds difference in when kubelet initiates preStop execution)\r\n\r\n3. When kubelet forcibly terminates containers, due to the inconsistent loop timings across containers, some loops might execute N times while others execute N+1 times\r\n\r\nTo mitigate these, I modified the loop timing to be configurable externally through ExecCommand parameters, which should help alleviate these issues.\r\n\r\n#### Does this PR introduce a user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf no, just write \"NONE\" in the release-note block below.\r\nIf yes, a release note is required:\r\nEnter your extended release note in the block below.

Specifically, the [ClearBGError() call](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/blob/c72e79a262bf696faf5f8becabf92374fc14b464/db/db_impl/db_impl.cc#L425) can release and re-acquire mutex, and DB can be closed during this time. So it's not safe to access DB states after ClearBGError(). There was a similar story in #9496. [Moving the obsolete files logic after ClearBGError()](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/pull/11955) probably makes the seg fault more easily triggered.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates `ClearBGError()` to guarantee that db close cannot finish until the method returns and the mutex is released. So that we can safely access DB states after calling it.\r\n\r\n\r\nTest plan: I could not trigger the seg fault locally, will just monitor future test failures.\r\n\r\n\n"}

Create a StatefulSet with the following manifests:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\napiVersion: v1\r\nkind: Service\r\nmetadata:\r\n  name: test\r\n  namespace: default\r\nspec:\r\n  clusterIP: None\r\n  selector:\r\n    app: test\r\n---\r\napiVersion: apps/v1\r\nkind: StatefulSet\r\nmetadata:\r\n  name: test\r\n  namespace: default\r\nspec:\r\n  replicas: 1\r\n  selector:\r\n    matchLabels:\r\n      app: test\r\n  serviceName: test\r\n  template:\r\n    metadata:\r\n      labels:\r\n        app: test\r\n    spec:\r\n      containers:\r\n      - command:\r\n        - pause\r\n        image: quay.io/cybozu/ubuntu:18.04\r\n        name: ubuntu\r\n        volumeMounts:\r\n        - mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html\r\n          name: www\r\n  volumeClaimTemplates:\r\n  - metadata:\r\n      name: www\r\n    spec:\r\n      accessModes:\r\n      - ReadWriteOnce\r\n      resources:\r\n        requests:\r\n          storage: 1Gi\r\n      volumeMode: Filesystem\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Once the pod gets running, edit PVC to add a finalizer `aaa.bbb/ccc`.\r\n4. Run `kubectl delete --wait=false pvc/www-test-0`.\r\n5. Run `kubectl delete --wait=false pods/test-0`.\r\n6. See a new pod is created and become pending.\r\n7. Edit the PVC to remove the `aaa.bbb/ccc` finalizer.\r\n8. See the PVC is get deleted.\r\n9. See the Pod remains pending forever.\r\n\r\n**Does this PR introduce a user-facing change?**:\r\n```release-note\r\nAdding fix to statefulset controller to wait for pvc deletion before creating pods.\r\n```\r\n\n"}

This makes debugging quite difficult.\nThis minor  change makes sure to just fail the test immediately, if a\nSmokeTestClient enters the ERROR state.\n\n2) If a test times out or fails prematurely, because a SmokeTestClient\ncrashed, the SmokeTestClients aren't shut down correctly, which will\naffect the following test runs. Therefore, I am adding clean-up logic\nthat running SmokeTestClients in `@AfterAll`.\n\n3) Finally, I found that the processingThread variation of this thread\ntriggers a subtle race condition. Since this features is currently not\nactively developed, I disabled those variations and created a ticket to\nreactivate the test.\n\nReviewers: Matthias J.

By using the same object creation method as the production code, the test becomes deterministic.\n"}

In short, if we rely on `self.index.packages` as a source of truth during error reporting, we open ourselves up to a source of non-determinism, because we fetch package metadata asynchronously in the background while we solve -- so packages _could_ be included in or excluded from the index depending on the order in which those requests are returned.\r\n\r\nSo, instead, we now track the set of packages that _were_ visited by the solver. Visiting a package _requires_ that we wait for its metadata to be available. By limiting analysis to those packages that were visited during solving, we are faithfully representing the state of the solver at the time of failure.\r\n\r\nCloses #863 \n"}

It also causes problems in our tests where two opened database session accessed database at the same time and it cases sqlite exception on concurrent access and mysql error on running operations out of sync - likely when the same object was modified in both sessions.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the approach - rather than creating a new session in the mapped_operator, we are retrieving the session from one stored by the _run_raw_task. It is done by context manager and adequate protection has been added to make sure that:\r\n\r\na) the call is made within the context manager\r\nb) context manageer is never initialized twice in the same\r\n   call stack\r\n\r\nAfter this change, resources used by running task will be smaller, and mapped tasks will not always open 2 DB sesions.\r\n\r\nFixes: #33178\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

After an operation finishes, `executeHolder` is [removed from a map](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/af16aa8e11c223642f928b0b9893854a851d70bb/sql/connect/server/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/connect/service/SparkConnectExecutionManager.scala#L153) so if the condition (1) is met, `executeHolder` is never set because `SparkConnectService.executionManager.getExecuteHolder` consistently returns `None`.\r\n\r\nOne example of the test affected by this issue is `SPARK-43923: commands send events - get_resources_command`.\r\nYou can easily reproduce this issue by inserting sleep into `MockSparkListener#onOtherEvent` like as follows.\r\n\r\n```\r\n   val executeKey =\r\n     ExecuteKey(sessionHolder.userId, sessionHolder.sessionId, e.operationId)\r\n+  Thread.sleep(1000)\r\n   executeHolder = SparkConnectService.executionManager.getExecuteHolder(executeKey)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then, run test.\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt 'connect/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.connect.planner.SparkConnectServiceSuite -- -z \"get_resources_command\"'\r\n```\r\nTo resolve this issue, this PR proposes:\r\n\r\n* Change `VerifyEvents#onCompleted` just to assert `executeHolder.eventsManager.getProducedRowCount == producedRowCount`\r\n* Call `VerifyEvents#onCompleted` from `StreamObserver#onCompleted`\r\n* Add `VerifyEvents#assertClosed` to check if the status is `Closed`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFor test stability.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nInserting `Thread.sleep(1000)` like mentioned above and then run `SparkConnectServiceSuite`.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\n"}

I suggest a new way to fix the test by adding some synchronization for the test execution only. I at first identify the source code location whose slow execution (from Line 436 to 442) leads to the flaky test failure. Hence, I introduce one variable in this test class  that is only there to provide some synchronization. Basically, until these statements are executed, I force the thread that shuts down the services. The waiting location is at Line 447 of this test class.\r\n\r\n### Failure:\r\nRunning org.fluentd.logger.TestFluentLogger\r\n2023-03-31 10:11:42,340 DEBUG [pool-2-thread-1] Started MockFluentd port:33845\r\nException in thread \"pool-3-thread-15\" java.lang.NullPointerException\r\nat org.fluentd.logger.FluentLogger.log(FluentLogger.java:101)\r\nat org.fluentd.logger.FluentLogger.log(FluentLogger.java:86)\r\nat org.fluentd.logger.TestFluentLogger$7.run(TestFluentLogger.java:436)\r\nat java.base/java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1128)\r\nat java.base/java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:628)\r\nat java.base/java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:829)\r\njava.lang.NullPointerException\r\nat org.fluentd.logger.FluentLogger.log(FluentLogger.java:101)\r\nat org.fluentd.logger.FluentLogger.log(FluentLogger.java:86)\r\nat org.fluentd.logger.TestFluentLogger$7.run(TestFluentLogger.java:436)\r\nat java.base/java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1128)\r\nat java.base/java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:628)\r\nat java.base/java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:829)\r\nException in thread \"pool-3-thread-7\" java.lang.NullPointerException\r\nat org.fluentd.logger.FluentLogger.log(FluentLogger.java:101)\r\nat org.fluentd.logger.FluentLogger.log(FluentLogger.java:86)\r\nat org.fluentd.logger.TestFluentLogger$7.run(TestFluentLogger.java:436)\r\nat java.base/java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1128)\r\nat java.base/java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:628)\r\nat java.base/java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:829)\r\nException in thread \"pool-3-thread-10\" java.lang.NullPointerException\r\nat org.fluentd.logger.FluentLogger.log(FluentLogger.java:101)\r\nat org.fluentd.logger.FluentLogger.log(FluentLogger.java:86)\r\nat org.fluentd.logger.TestFluentLogger$7.run(TestFluentLogger.java:436)\r\nat java.base/java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1128)\r\nat java.base/java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:628)\r\nat java.base/java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:829)\r\n2023-03-31 10:16:50,774 ERROR [main] Timed out\r\n2023-03-31 10:16:50,774 DEBUG [pool-2-thread-1] Terminated MockFluentd port:33845\r\nTests run: 1, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 308.585 sec <<< FAILURE!\r\n\r\n### Results :\r\n\r\nFailed tests:\r\ntestInMultiThreading(org.fluentd.logger.TestFluentLogger): expected:<210000> but was:<209591>\r\n\r\nTests run: 1, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\n"}

In the wild, this is most likely to manifest on different architectures with different JVM versions.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/fury/blob/54b62fb6ab5d7e557131efe07c7402c885f6e7c4/java/fury-core/src/main/java/org/apache/fury/reflect/ReflectionUtils.java#L368-L381\r\n\r\nUsing [NonDex](https://github.com/TestingResearchIllinois/NonDex), we can replicate the flaky behavior with the following command:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmvn edu.illinois:nondex-maven-plugin:2.1.7:nondex -pl fury-core/ -Dcheckstyle.skip -Dmaven.javadoc.skip -Dtest=org.apache.fury.codegen.ExpressionVisitorTest\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe fix, in this case, is to simply use HashSet equality instead of an ordered List equality. The above NonDex command should succeed after applying this patch.\r\n\r\nI do, however, note that there are other flaky tests (found by running NonDex on the entire `fury-core` project) that fail due to reliance on e.g. `PriorityQueue#toArray`, which is also explicity marked to return nondeterministically ordered arrays.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\n"}

So `executeHolder.eventsManager.hasError.isDefined` never changes to `true`.\r\n\r\n`VerifyEvents#onNext` is indirectly called from [ExecuteGrpcResponseSender#sendResponse](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/9d27db940673196f64b1568d73c459f83eb6f788/sql/connect/server/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/connect/execution/ExecuteGrpcResponseSender.scala#L398), which runs on a sender thread.\r\nOn the other hand, an operation status is changed on another thread. Especially, transition to `Analyzed` status is done [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/9d27db940673196f64b1568d73c459f83eb6f788/sql/connect/server/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/connect/execution/SparkConnectPlanExecution.scala#L75). But the status can transition to `ReadyForExecution` or `Finished` before `VerifyEvents#onNext` is called.\r\nSo, those tests can occasionally fail.\r\n\r\nYou can easily reproduce this issue by inserting sleep like as follows and then run those tests.\r\n```\r\n   def onNext(v: proto.ExecutePlanResponse): Unit = {\r\n     if (v.hasSchema) {\r\n+      Thread.sleep(5000)\r\n       assert(executeHolder.eventsManager.status == ExecuteStatus.Analyzed)\r\n     }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe solution this PR proposes is just removing the assertion.\r\nIn `VerifyEvents#onNext`, there is another assertion `assert(executeHolder.eventsManager.status == ExecuteStatus.Finished)` and I think having only this assertion is enough because the status changes to `Finished` through `Analyzed`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFor test stability.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nInserting sleep into `onNext` like explained above and run the problematic tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n\n"}

Inside the settings part it opens the editor, edits it and saves the file via ctrl/cmd+s. This is all fine, but it doesn't verify anything so the editor may end up closing before ctrl/cmd+s actually gets handled. We disable the modal in smoke tests since it needs to run headlessly, so it's difficult to see that the file never actually saves and a dirty file is closed and discarded.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to verify settings.json actually does save by changing the shared Editors.saveOpenedFile mechanism to ensure the dirty indicator isn't present on the active tab.\r\n\r\nFixes #254893\r\nPart of #246731\r\n\r\nFYI @aiday-mar \r\n\r\n<!-- Thank you for submitting a Pull Request.

It turns out that the tests had side-effect - they have not waited for the TriggererJob thread to complete, they merely marked them to be stopped, but they have not waited for those to complete - this is quite plausible explanation of the flaky test failures - since those threads have 1 second sleep, it's more than likely that the session has been created and used by the thread while the teardown has been attempting to close all the sessions.\r\n\r\nThis side effect could also have an effect for other tests that were run after - because in a busy test run machine, the side effects could propagate further than just to the teardown, so it could also explain why sometimes (very rarely) other job tests failed with similar errors.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to join the runner after marking it to be stopped.\r\n\r\nFixes: #33323 (Hopefully)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

After an operation finishes, `executeHolder` is [removed from a map](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/af16aa8e11c223642f928b0b9893854a851d70bb/sql/connect/server/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/connect/service/SparkConnectExecutionManager.scala#L153) so if the condition (1) is met, `executeHolder` is never set because `SparkConnectService.executionManager.getExecuteHolder` consistently returns `None`.\r\n\r\nOne example of the test affected by this issue is `SPARK-43923: commands send events - get_resources_command`.\r\nYou can easily reproduce this issue by inserting sleep into `MockSparkListener#onOtherEvent` like as follows.\r\n\r\n```\r\n   val executeKey =\r\n     ExecuteKey(sessionHolder.userId, sessionHolder.sessionId, e.operationId)\r\n+  Thread.sleep(1000)\r\n   executeHolder = SparkConnectService.executionManager.getExecuteHolder(executeKey)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then, run test.\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt 'connect/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.connect.planner.SparkConnectServiceSuite -- -z \"get_resources_command\"'\r\n```\r\nTo resolve this issue, this PR proposes:\r\n\r\n* Change `VerifyEvents#onCompleted` just to assert `executeHolder.eventsManager.getProducedRowCount == producedRowCount`\r\n* Call `VerifyEvents#onCompleted` from `StreamObserver#onCompleted`\r\n* Add `VerifyEvents#assertClosed` to check if the status is `Closed`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFor test stability.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nInserting `Thread.sleep(1000)` like mentioned above and then run `SparkConnectServiceSuite`.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\n"}

(It's old.) It required that as soon as it became aware that the Service and its Endpoints/EndpointSlice had been updated, that the apiserver proxying codepath must _also_ be aware of them, and must _immediately_ be able to proxy connections to the service, and if not, then the test fails. Apparently it was flaky even before the changes. But #129837 made things much worse because [now the proxying codepath uses an informer and a lister rather than using a client directly](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129837#discussion_r2001237237), so it's much more possible for the apiserver proxy code to have not noticed the Service/EndpointSlice yet at the point when e2e.test has noticed it.\r\n\r\nAnyway, fix is just to poll for the apiserver to be ready before we start.\r\n\r\nOh, also, the conformance description of the test was _completely_ wrong. It looks like when the conformance comments were added, someone copied the description of the wrong test? So I fixed that too.\r\n\r\n(Also, update to use the new `e2eendpointslice.WaitForEndpointCount`.)\r\n\r\n#### Which issue(s) this PR is related to:\r\nFixes #133257\r\n\r\n#### Does this PR introduce a user-facing change?\r\n```release-note\r\nNONE\r\n```\r\n\r\n/sig network\r\n/priority important-soon\r\n/triage accepted\r\n/milestone v1.34\n"}
